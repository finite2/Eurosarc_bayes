Description: Bayesian sample size calculation software and examples for EuroSARC
    clinical trials which utilise Bayesian methodology. These trials rely on
    binomial based endpoints so the majority of programs found here relate to this
    sort of endpoint. Developed as part of the EuroSARC FP7 grant.
